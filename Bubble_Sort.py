# Bubble Sort is used for sorting values on the list
# It compares and swap list's value from the top and the bigger value goes behind the comparing value.
# Once the value is sorted this function compares the rest of the values on the list which are not sorted properly.
## Note to this function is eventually values are sorted in order of their scales, for example first value which sorted behind the list is the biggest value in that list.
## If the values are properly sorted in the first place, there are no values that are needed to be swaped.
